# Timed-Quiz

# Description

I built this timed quiz in order to test my knowledge of web development. The application presents the user a multi choice quiz of web development concepts. I used HTML, CSS  & JavaScript to build this application. I am facing the challenge of rendering the top scores on the scores.html page. I hope to fix this problem shortly. 

#Use

In order to use app, follow the link and click on the start button to begin. After the start button is clicked a timer will start and you will be presented with a multi question quiz where you can click on a question, if correct the question container will turn green and a score will be recorded and a next button will be presented. If incorrect the container will turn red, the correct question will turn green, the timer will be decimated by 10 seconds and a next button will be presented. After you answer all the questions you will be presented with an end screen that will display your score and allow you to record your initials. The score is calculated by number of questions correct * remaining time.  Once you click the submit button, and this is where I am having a bit of trouble, you will be directed to another page that will display the top 5 scores, stored in the local storage, and initials of the person who achieved the score.  On this page you will see the high scores and a try again button that will restart the app,

#Contributions 

During the development of this app I had help from my friend Ben Wyess, tutor Corey Yates. When faced with a challenge in the development of this app I looked through posts on stackoverflow as well as utilizing the Ed Ex Expert app and GitHub copilot to look for problems in my code.
